# File Organizer Automation Script (Python)

## Overview
This project is a Python automation script designed to organize files automatically by type, helping reduce manual work, human errors, and time wasted managing unstructured folders.

## Problem Statement
In many real-world environments, files are often stored in a single directory without proper organization. This leads to disorganization, repetitive manual tasks, increased errors, and reduced productivity.

## Solution
The script scans a source folder, identifies files based on their extensions, and moves them into categorized folders inside an output directory. This automation minimizes repetitive work and improves file management efficiency.
